echo "📋 Current Status Check:"
echo "Current diagram type in ENIP directory:"
head -3 diagrams/ENIP/diagram.dot | grep "digraph"
echo ""

echo "🎯 To Generate Network Diagram:"
echo ""
echo "Option 1: Network diagram only"
echo "  ./cipgram -pcap your_network.pcap -diagram network"
echo "  Result: diagram.dot (NetworkSegmentation type)"
echo ""

echo "Option 2: Both diagrams (recommended)"
echo "  ./cipgram -pcap your_network.pcap -both"
echo "  Result: purdue_diagram.dot + network_diagram.dot"
echo ""

echo "Option 3: Fast network analysis"
echo "  ./cipgram -pcap large_network.pcap -diagram network -fast"
echo "  Result: Quick network topology without vendor lookups"
echo ""

echo "📁 Expected Network Diagram Output:"
echo "  diagrams/your_pcap/"
echo "  ├── network_diagram.dot      # DOT source starting with 'digraph NetworkSegmentation'"
echo "  ├── network_diagram.png      # Network topology image"

echo "🔍 Network Diagram Features:"
echo "  • Horizontal layout (Left-to-Right)"
echo "  • Infrastructure: Internet → Firewall → Router"
echo "  • Network segments based on CIDR detection"
echo "  • Color-coded: Green (OT), Blue (IT), Gray (Mixed)"
echo "  • Key assets per network segment (top 5)"
echo ""

echo "⚠️  Current Issue:"
echo "  The existing diagrams are Purdue type (functional model)"
echo "  To get network diagrams, you need to:"
echo "  1. Have a PCAP file to analyze"
echo "  2. Run with -diagram network or -both flag"
echo "  3. The tool will then generate the network topology view"
echo ""

echo "✅ Solution:"
echo "  Provide a PCAP file and use: ./cipgram -pcap file.pcap -both"
