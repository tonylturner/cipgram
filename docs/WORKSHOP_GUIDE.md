# CIPgram OT Network Segmentation Workshop Guide

## üéØ Workshop Overview

This guide provides structured learning modules for conducting OT network segmentation workshops using CIPgram.

## üìö Learning Modules

### **Module 1: Network Discovery & Visualization (30 min)**
**Objective**: Understand current network topology and asset inventory

#### **Exercise 1.1: Basic Network Analysis**
```bash
# Analyze a simple manufacturing network
./cipgram config fwconfigs/manufacturing_insecure.xml project "module1_discovery"

# Students examine:
# - Network topology diagram
# - Asset inventory
# - Protocol usage
```

**Discussion Points**:
- What networks are present?
- Which protocols are in use?
- Are there any unexpected connections?

#### **Exercise 1.2: PCAP Traffic Analysis**
```bash
# Analyze actual network traffic
./cipgram pcap pcaps/Cyberville.pcap project "module1_traffic"

# Students examine:
# - Discovered assets and vendors
# - Communication patterns
# - Protocol conversations
```

### **Module 2: Security Assessment (45 min)**
**Objective**: Identify security risks and vulnerabilities

#### **Exercise 2.1: Risk Identification**
```bash
# Compare secure vs insecure configurations
./cipgram config fwconfigs/water_treatment_secure.xml project "module2_secure"
./cipgram config fwconfigs/manufacturing_insecure.xml project "module2_insecure"
```

**Discussion Points**:
- What makes one configuration more secure?
- Identify specific risk factors
- Compare network segmentation approaches

#### **Exercise 2.2: Policy Violation Detection**
```bash
# Combined analysis to find policy violations
./cipgram combined network_traffic.pcap firewall.xml project "module2_violations"
```

### **Module 3: IEC 62443 Compliance (45 min)**
**Objective**: Understand zone-based security architecture

#### **Exercise 3.1: Zone Classification**
```bash
# Analyze different industry configurations
./cipgram config fwconfigs/power_substation_mixed.xml project "module3_power"
./cipgram config fwconfigs/water_treatment_secure.xml project "module3_water"
```

**Discussion Points**:
- How are zones defined in each industry?
- What are the conduit requirements?
- Compare risk levels between zones

### **Module 4: Segmentation Planning (60 min)**
**Objective**: Design improved network segmentation

#### **Exercise 4.1: Before/After Analysis**
```bash
# Analyze current state
./cipgram config fwconfigs/manufacturing_insecure.xml project "module4_before"

# Students design improvements, then analyze improved config
./cipgram config fwconfigs/manufacturing_improved.xml project "module4_after"
```

#### **Exercise 4.2: Custom Scenario Design**
Students create their own firewall configuration based on a given industrial scenario.
