# Advanced Analysis Features

## Combined PCAP + Firewall Analysis

When CIPgram has both network traffic (PCAP) and firewall configuration data, it can perform advanced analysis that's impossible with either source alone.

### Analysis Capabilities

#### **Policy Violation Detection**
Compares actual network traffic against configured firewall rules:
- Identifies unauthorized communication flows
- Detects traffic that bypasses intended security controls
- Highlights potential security gaps in rule configuration

#### **Segmentation Opportunity Analysis**
Analyzes traffic patterns to identify microsegmentation opportunities:
- Cross-zone traffic that could be further restricted
- Unnecessary protocol usage between network segments
- Assets that could benefit from dedicated network segments

#### **Security Posture Assessment**
Provides quantitative security metrics:
- Compliance score based on policy coverage of actual traffic
- Risk assessment combining asset criticality and exposure
- Trend analysis for security improvement over time

#### **Asset Reconciliation**
Merges device information from multiple sources:
- Validates firewall configuration against discovered assets
- Identifies "shadow IT" devices not accounted for in firewall rules
- Correlates MAC addresses with IP assignments

## IEC 62443 Compliance Analysis

### Zone and Conduit Framework

CIPgram implements the IEC 62443 security architecture:

#### **Zone Classification**
- **Manufacturing Zone (Levels 0-2)**: Process control, safety systems, field devices
- **DMZ Zone**: Network perimeter, historians, remote access points  
- **Enterprise Zone (Levels 3-5)**: Business systems, engineering workstations
- **Safety Zone**: Safety instrumented systems (SIS)
- **Remote Access Zone**: VPN and remote connectivity

#### **Conduit Analysis**
Identifies and validates communication channels between zones:
- Authorized inter-zone communication paths
- Security requirements for each conduit (encryption, authentication)
- Risk assessment for cross-zone traffic

### Compliance Reporting

#### **Zone Diagram Generation**
Creates IEC 62443-compliant network diagrams showing:
- Clear zone boundaries and labels
- Assets properly classified within zones
- Conduits with security level requirements
- Risk-based color coding

#### **Gap Analysis**
Identifies compliance gaps:
- Assets in incorrect zones
- Missing or inadequate conduit security
- Unauthorized cross-zone communication
- Non-compliant network architecture

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Asset Criticality Classification

#### **Critical Assets**
- Safety systems (SIS, emergency shutdown)
- Primary process controllers
- Key infrastructure components

#### **High Criticality Assets**  
- Secondary controllers and HMIs
- Process historians and data servers
- Network infrastructure (switches, firewalls)

#### **Medium/Low Criticality Assets**
- Engineering workstations
- Temporary systems and tools
- Non-process related devices

### Exposure Assessment

#### **Internet Exposed**
Assets with direct or potential Internet connectivity:
- DMZ-hosted services
- Remote access points
- Misconfigured firewall rules

#### **Corporate Exposed**
Assets accessible from corporate networks:
- Shared services and data exchanges
- Management interfaces
- Cross-domain connectivity

#### **OT Only**
Assets isolated to operational technology networks:
- Field devices and controllers
- Process-specific systems
- Air-gapped network segments

## Usage Examples

### Complete Security Assessment (Planned Feature)
```bash
./cipgram combined production_traffic.pcap opnsense_config.xml project "quarterly_security_review"
```

### PCAP Analysis for Segmentation Planning
```bash
./cipgram pcap current_baseline.pcap project "microsegmentation_planning" diagram=both
```

### Firewall Configuration Analysis
```bash
./cipgram config production_firewall.xml project "policy_compliance_check"
```

## Output Analysis

## Integration with Security Tools

### SIEM Integration
CIPgram output can be integrated with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:
- JSON format for automated ingestion
- Alert generation for policy violations
- Trend analysis and anomaly detection

### Change Management
Track security posture changes over time:
- Baseline establishment and deviation detection
- Configuration change impact assessment
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## Best Practices

### Data Collection
1. **Capture representative traffic** - Include normal operations, maintenance windows, and edge cases
2. **Use current firewall configurations** - Ensure config files match the traffic capture timeframe
3. **Document network changes** - Note any modifications during capture period

### Analysis Approach
1. **Start with baseline analysis** - Establish current state before making changes
2. **Focus on high-risk findings** - Prioritize critical assets and Internet-exposed systems
3. **Validate findings** - Confirm policy violations aren't legitimate business requirements
4. **Plan implementation phases** - Implement changes gradually to avoid service disruption

### Ongoing Management
1. **Regular compliance checks** - Monthly or quarterly analysis cycles
2. **Change validation** - Analyze impact before implementing network changes
3. **Trend monitoring** - Track security posture improvements over time
4. **Documentation updates** - Keep network diagrams and policies current
