  - Configurable cache sizes
  - Memory-aware cache eviction

### 🎯 **Medium Priority**
- [ ] **Memory Profiling & Optimization**: Profile memory usage and optimize allocations
  - Add memory profiling endpoints
  - Identify allocation hotspots
  - Implement object pooling where beneficial
  - Add memory usage monitoring

---

## 🏗️ **Phase 3: Architecture Enhancement** 📋 **PLANNED**

### 🎯 **Configuration Management**
- [ ] **Centralize Configuration**: Create unified configuration system
  - Create `pkg/config` package
  - Support multiple config sources (file, env, flags)
  - Add configuration validation
  - Implement hot-reloading

### 🎯 **Observability**
- [ ] **Add Metrics & Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring
  - Add Prometheus metrics
  - Create health check endpoints
  - Implement structured logging
  - Add performance dashboards

---

## 🔧 **Phase 4: Production Readiness** 📋 **PLANNED**

### 🎯 **Operational Excellence**
- [ ] **Health Checks & Graceful Shutdown**: Add production operational features
  - Implement readiness/liveness probes
  - Add graceful shutdown handling
  - Resource cleanup on exit
  - Signal handling

- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Add pprof endpoints for performance analysis
  - HTTP pprof endpoints
  - CPU profiling
  - Memory profiling
  - Goroutine analysis

---

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

### **Performance Targets**
- [ ] **PCAP Processing**: Maintain 30K+ packets/second
- [ ] **Memory Efficiency**: <100MB for typical workloads
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage

- ✅ **No Plugin System**: Focus on core functionality first

### **Future Considerations**
- **API Layer**: May add REST API in future phases
- **Plugin System**: Consider for protocol analyzers expansion
- **Web UI**: Potential future enhancement for visualization
